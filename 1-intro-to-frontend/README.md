# Note-taking Web Page
Your goal is to use the code provided in [`starter`](starter) to create a simple note-taking page.
Some code is provided for you to make certain sections easier and to give you an idea of what to add.
You may add JavaScript and CSS directly to [`index.html`](starter/index.html), but it is recommended to add those to their respective files: [`main.js`](starter/main.js) and [`styles.css`](starter/styles.css).

### Required Features
The following features are required, but you can add additional ones once you finish these.
* Add another `<input>` to the `<form>`
* Add a submission button to the form
* Create new notes using the below template and insert them into the `<div>` with `id="notes"`.
```html
<article>
    <h3>Title Text</h3>
    <p>Body Text</p>
</article>
```
* Add styles to the newly-created notes without changing the other `<p>` or `<h3>` elements not used for the notes (there are many ways to do this)

### Bonus Features
The bonus features have a difficulty indicator in front of them.
If you are comfortable jumping straight into harder ones, go ahead.
There are many unique—and often equally-good—ways to complete them.
##### Easy
* Add the word "Body" to the start of each of the note bodies
* Add random capitalization to the note titles
##### Medium
* Require the user to solve a "Captcha" (compute the answer to a simple math problem) before they can add the new note
* Change the form layout to be more user-friendly
##### Hard
* The ability to delete notes
