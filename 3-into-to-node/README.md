# DOM-changing buttons with React

Your goal is to use the code provided in [`starter`](starter) to create a page with buttons that manipulate the style
and content of the page. Some code is provided for you to make certain sections easier and to give you an idea of what
to add.

### Required Features

#### Checkpoint 1

Do you have...

* The site visible in your browser?
* A button that decreases the font size?
* A button that changes another style of the paragraph?

#### Checkpoint 2

Do you have...

* A button that changes another style, but only when double-clicked (without using the `dbclick` event)?
* A specific style setting that is applied only when you hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and press the button?

#### Checkpoint 3

* Is there a button at the bottom of the page that creates a new button when clicked?
* Do new buttons delete themselves when clicked?
